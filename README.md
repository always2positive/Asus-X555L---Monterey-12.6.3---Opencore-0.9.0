# Asus-X555L---Monterey 12.6.3---Opencore 0.9.0


For educational purposes only, I am sharing my Hackintosh EFI of a 100% working MacOs Monterey on my old friend Asus X555L


I have followed Dortania's intallation guide, some things were "easy" and some took me weeks to figure out, and got a 100% functional hack.

This is my hardware:

   The Specs:
- Motherboard : Asus X555L
- CPU : Intel® Core™ i3 - 5020U (4) @ 2.20GHz 
- iGPU : Intel HD Graphics 5500
- RAM : 1x 8 GB DDR3-1600 SODIMM  1x4 GB DDR3-1600 SODIMM
- Audio Codec :  ALC233/ALC3236
- WiFi /BT : Intel AC7260
- Display: Built-In 15.6”
- Resolution : 1366px x 768px
- Storage : 1x SSD KINGSTON 250GB
- Bootloader : OpenCore 0.9.0
- macOS Version : macOS Monterey 12.6.3
- SMBios : MacBookAir 7.2
                                 
 What it's working:
 
 Everything!!! but pretty sure battery support can be improved, its a little buggy at the moment.
 
 Just generate your own SMBios, create the USB installer and copy the EFI content of this repo in a USB - Hope to help someone out there and save you some pain.
 
 Cheers!
