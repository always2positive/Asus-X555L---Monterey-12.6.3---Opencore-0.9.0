# Asus-X555L---Big-Sur---Opencore


For educational purposes only, I am sharing my Hackingtosh EFI of a 98% working MacOs Big Sur on my old friend Asus X555L


I have followed Dortania's intallation guide, some things were "easy" and some took me weeks to figure out, and got a 98% functional hack.

This is my hardware:

                    'c.          MacBook-Air.7.1 
                 ,xNMM.          ---------------------- 
               .OMMMMo           OS: macOS 11.6.8 20G730 x86_64 
               OMMM0,            Host: Hackintosh (SMBIOS: MacBookAir7,1) 
    kMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMd     CPU: Intel i3-5020U (4) @ 2.20GHz 
     ;KMMMMMMMWXXWMMMMMMMk.      GPU: Intel HD Graphics 5500 
       .cooc,.    .,coo:.        Memory: 6753MiB / 12288MiB 
                                 Audio : ALC233/ALC3236
                                 Wifi : Atheros 9485
                                 
 What it's working:
 
 Everything!!! but pretty sure battery support can be improved, its a little buggy at the moment.
 
 Hope to help someone out there and save you some pain.
 
 Cheers!
